# Backend Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

We have successfully implemented a simplified backend API with the following features:

1. **Working API Endpoints**:

    - `/health` - Returns a simple 'OK' response to verify the API is running
    - `/images` - Returns sample image data in JSON format

2. **CORS Support**:

    - Configured to allow requests from the `https://fotods.no` origin
    - Properly handles OPTIONS preflight requests
    - Sets necessary CORS headers for cross-origin requests

3. **Infrastructure Setup**:

    - Node.js Express application running on port 3000
    - Nginx as a reverse proxy listening on port 80
    - PM2 for process management and auto-restart
    - Proper service setup to ensure the API starts on system boot

4. **Connectivity**:
    - API accessible via direct IP: http://51.21.110.161
    - API accessible via domain name: http://api.fotods.no

## Testing Results

All API tests are now passing:

1. Direct health check: http://api.fotods.no/health
2. Images endpoint: http://api.fotods.no/images
3. CORS preflight requests (OPTIONS method)
4. Cross-origin browser requests from fotods.no

## Root Cause Analysis

The original implementation had several issues:

1. **Port Binding Issue**: The Node.js application was not properly binding to port 8000, possibly due to permission issues or a port conflict.

2. **Nginx Configuration**: The Nginx configuration had syntax errors in the proxy settings and CORS headers.

3. **Complex Setup**: The original implementation was overly complex, making it difficult to diagnose issues.

4. **DNS/Connectivity**: There were potential issues with DNS propagation or security groups.

## Next Steps

To improve the implementation and make it more robust, consider:

1. **HTTPS Setup**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    sudo certbot --nginx -d api.fotods.no
    ```

2. **Persistence and Database Integration**:

    - Add a MongoDB or PostgreSQL database for storing real image data
    - Implement proper data models and schemas

3. **Enhanced API Features**:

    - Add authentication (JWT tokens)
    - Implement image upload functionality
    - Add pagination for large datasets
    - Implement filtering and sorting options

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:

    - Set up proper logging with Winston or similar
    - Add error tracking
    - Implement request/response logging
    - Set up monitoring with PM2 monitoring or similar tools

5. **Maintenance Plan**:
    - Regular backups of data
    - Security updates
    - Performance monitoring
    - Load testing

## Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter issues in the future:

1. **API is not responding**:

    ```bash
    # Check if services are running
    sudo systemctl status nginx
    pm2 list

    # Restart services if needed
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    pm2 restart simple-api
    ```

2. **CORS issues**:

    - Verify the origin in the CORS configuration matches the frontend origin
    - Check browser console for specific CORS errors
    - Ensure preflight requests are properly handled

3. **Performance issues**:
    - Monitor server resources (CPU, memory)
    - Consider scaling with additional instances
    - Optimize database queries
    - Implement caching

## Conclusion

The simplified API is now working correctly and should provide a stable foundation for the fotods.no application. The current implementation is intentionally minimal but provides all the necessary functionality for the basic needs of the application. As the application grows, follow the next steps to enhance the API's capabilities and ensure its reliability.
